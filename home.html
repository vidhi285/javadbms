    <p><b>Navrachana University was established through the <u>Gujarat Private Universities Act, 2009</u> with the intent to offer superior education that befits the high educational standards of the Navrachana Educational Society in Vadodara. The University has embarked on a new educational paradigm that lays simultaneous emphasis on disciplinary education, inter-disciplinary education, professional education and general education. This paradigm is facilitated by the University’s unitary character and offers comprehensive learning and <u>helps develop T-Shape students who have a breadth of knowledge though general and inter-disciplinary education</u> and a depth of knowledge though focused disciplinary education.
        <br><br>
      <u>There are five important aspects that direct the new educational paradigm at Navrachana University:</u><br>
      
      Professional education must prepare students with <u>strong disciplinary</u> insights needed to address the challenges confronting the professional community and inculcate a sense of lifelong learning to be successful and excel overtime.
      Offer interdisciplinary education that cross-fertilize learning with new ideas from desperate disciplines so collision at the fringes raise appropriate questions and create innovation.
      General education must inform students about <u>the issues that arise in their lives, personally, professionally, and socially and help them to be reflective about their beliefs and choices, and their presuppositions and motivations.</u>
      Make the process of learning more effective through exposure into <u>real working conditions by practically applying knowledge and skills learned in the classroom.</u>
      Invite students to work on “messy”, seemingly intractable problems through a focus on social entrepreneurship and address pressing problems in our immediate community. 
      Disciplinary-specific <u>entrepreneurship is being developed to create job creators who will create opportunities for themselves and for others.</u></b></p>
